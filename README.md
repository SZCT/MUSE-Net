# A Multi-Task Deep Learning Model for Estimating Earthquake Magnitude and Slip Distribution Using High-Rate GNSS, Strong-Motion Data, and Magnitude-Derived Priors
This repository contains the model implementation used in our study:
**“MPMSE: A Multi-Source Deep Learning Framework for Estimating Earthquake Magnitude and Slip Distribution”**  
The model integrates high-rate GNSS displacement and strong-motion velocity waveforms to jointly estimate:
- Earthquake magnitude (Mw)
- Maximum slip
- Slip area (rupture zone)
- Normalized slip distribution
- Final slip distribution reconstructed from maximum slip and normalized slip distribution

Only the model structure is released.
